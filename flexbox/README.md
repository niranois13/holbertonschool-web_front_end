## What is Flexbox ?
**Flexbox**, _CSS Flexible Layout_, is a CSS layout model that specify the layout of HTML pages.
Created in 2009 by the _CSS Working Group_, a commitee created by the W3C (a consortium including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla and Opera Software amongst other actors of the web),
 **Flexbox** was created to answer the need of responsivness due to the _'mobilization'_ of web pages. 
Flexbox allows to design web page layouts based on the viewing environment.
_Flex boxes_ can adjust in size (increasing or decreasing) to make content fit within its boundaries.
Unlike other CSS layout models, **Flexbox** allows bi-directional layouts.
